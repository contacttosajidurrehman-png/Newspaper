        <h2>Why Basketball Is Not Popular in Pakistan</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball is a popular sport in many countries of the world, especially in the United States, Europe, and China. However, in Pakistan, basketball is not very popular and international basketball matches are rarely played. There are several reasons why basketball has not developed well in Pakistan.

        <p>
            One of the main reasons is the lack of popularity. In Pakistan, people mostly love cricket. Football and hockey are also played in many areas, but basketball does not get much attention from the public or the media. When a sport is not popular, it does not receive enough support from fans, sponsors, or sports authorities.
            Another important reason is the lack of proper facilities. Basketball needs indoor courts, good flooring, and modern equipment. In Pakistan, there are very few standard basketball courts, especially at the international level. Many schools and colleges do not have proper basketball grounds, which makes it difficult for young players to practice and improve their skills.One of the main reasons is the lack of popularity.
